                <p>Co-Farming Hub serves for the umbrella company for Canopy Accelerator Co-operative Limited (CACL) thus one of our running projects. CACL is a Wyndham-based 
                    social enterprise focused on increasing tree canopy cover in Wyndham 
                    and the western suburbs of Melbourne. It establishes community-owned 
                    tree nurseries to grow and plant trees through its tree planting teams. 
                    As a non-profit, CACL sells seedlings and advanced trees and provides 
                    planting services for Tiny Forests and other clients, including councils 
                    and private companies. The WynTree Friends Group, operating at the WynTree Nursery 
                    in Point Cook Coastal Park, encourages local community participation by offering volunteer 
                    opportunities to grow tree seedlings, enhancing the environment for future generations.</p>

                <p>Wyndham has the lowest percentage of tree canopy cover in the Greater Melbourne Area

                <h2 class="section-title">Our Approach</h2>
                <p>The approach includes developing a pilot project in Wyndham, acquiring access to crown land, and using co-operative or social enterprise business models to promote social and economic inclusion, job creation, and financial sustainability.</p>
                <h3>Tiny Forests</h3>
                <div class="visual-representation">
                    <img src="..\..\images/tiny-forest.webp" alt="Image related to Tiny Forests">
                </div>
                <p>This project aims to establish Tiny Forests which are also promoted and supported by Earthwatch Australia in order to raise WYndham's canopy cover.</p>
                <h3>What are Tiny Forests?</h3>
                <ul class="steps">
                    <li>600 trees planted densely in a tennis-court size plot, maximising benefits per m2 of land</li>
                    <li>Planting method encourages accelerated forest development and uses no chemicals or fertilisers</li>
                    <li>Low management and maintenance requirements after the first 2 years</li>
                    <li>Rich biodiversity, capable of attracting over 500 animal and plant species within the first 3 years</li>
                    <li>A nature-rich accessible green space and outdoor classroom for people to reconnect with nature</li>
                    <li>Monitoring data gathered by citizen scientists to help understand how Tiny Forests develop, and quantify the climate benefits</li>
                    <li>Links to business sustainability, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and environmental, social corporate governance (ESG)</li>
                    <li>Tiny Forest can connect people with nature in their local area and support general wellbeing. They offer a place to relax, watch wildlife and an educational resource.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each forest is expected to engage:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Up to 100 volunteers on planting and monitoring days</li>
                        <li>4-6 volunteers as a Keeper Team to care the forest</li>
                        <li>The wider community, visitors and school children as an inspiring place to enjoy nature</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
